    "text": "Computational Biology is unusually accessible as an applied science in part because so much can be done by an individual on modest hardware without access to a laboratory or computing cluster. All you need to bring is your brain.\nA large part of the reason for the accessibility of the topic is the sustained drive for Open Science practised by bioinformatics, computational biologists, and other scientists. These have encouraged, and sometimes demanded, open, free, FAIR (findable, accessible, interoperable, reusable) data, which has benefited us all.\nThis page lists some of the incredibly valuable, open data resources that might be of use to you in your project. It is not an exhaustive list."

    "section": "1 Conducting Your Project",
    "text": "1 Conducting Your Project\n\nSome general advice about the group \nHow to avoid cognitive overload \n\n\n1.1 Science:\n\nMaintain a detailed record of your work (i.e. a lab notebook), either on paper or electronically.\n\nAll the projects run by our group are computational. You will probably find it easiest to maintain an electronic record.\nKeeping a lab notebook to document your project \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nImportant\n\n\n\n\nBack up your work frequently and in more than one place - you do not want to lose all of your data!\n\nIt’s a common view in computation biology that, if there are not three copies of your data/work (ideally in two physical locations), it might as well not exist.\n\n\n\n\n\nAt the end of the project, I expect you to provide me with the raw data files from your work. For example:\n\nFor a phylogenetic tree, I expect: the .fasta file containing the unaligned sequences; the multiple sequence alignment used to construct the tree (.fasta, .msa, etc.); and the .newick (or .nex) file for the tree. This is required so that projects can be continued and built upon in future years.\nYou may find it most convenient to manage your project using standard computational biology tools, such as version control (e.g. git and GitHub). I would also find that convenient and strongly recommend it.\n\n\n\n\n1.2 Teamwork and collegiality:\n\nGroup Code of Conduct \nI expect you to help each other. In particular, some of you will have more experience than others in the group, when using computational and bioinformatics tools. You are all doing different projects, but you are using similar tools and techniques. I expect you to share knowledge and understanding kindly with one another.\n\nScience is a team effort and it benefits from people working together in groups. We can accomplish more together than one person working alone can.\nListen respectfully to each other, learn from each other, and contribute as you can.\nBe respectful of others’ different life experiences. Learn from them when appropriate, and contribute when appropriate. Do not insult or put down people who share their experiences.\n\nIf you find that you have made a mistake: listen, offer a genuine apology, and commit to learning and doing better.\n\n\n\n1.3 Kindness:\n\nBe kind to yourself. Be mindful of your limits, and aware of the fact that this is a world in crisis, with a myriad challenges.\n\nGive yourself credit for the hard work that you’re doing every day.\n\nBe kind to others. Give them the benefit of the doubt when needed; remember that online communication often misses nuance or meaning.\n\nRemember that everyone is struggling right now and may not be able to be their best selves.\n\nBe patient. Science can be hard work. Things take longer to accomplish when you are first learning a technique. You may need to repeat experiments or start over with a new dataset. This is all part of the process, and to be expected.\n\nBe assured that you are making progress, even though it may not feel that way at the time.\n\n\n\n\n1.4 Good Communication:\n\nHow to ask for feedback \nHow to ask good questions \nBe clear, open, and honest in your communication\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCaution\n\n\n\nI cannot help if you don’t let me know that there’s a problem.\n\n\n\nWe will meet at least once a week in person or via Zoom (individual and/or group meetings).\n\nZoom etiquette: turning your camera, microphone on/off is completely up to you, no pressure either way.\n\nBetween meetings, I’m available by email to answer questions or you can schedule a drop-in Zoom (depending on our schedules).\nDon’t be afraid to ask for help. You have many resources to call on, including:\n\nMe (…this is literally my job!)\nEach other. Please do talk to and help each other! - we call this “Peer Learning” and it’s deliberately part of the project. It’s not cheating or plagiarism.\nAnyone else in the SIPBS CompBiol Group\nThe Microbiology group\nAsk questions in your lectures/open office sessions\nStack Overflow, Bioinformatics Stack Exchange and other specialist sites\nSocial Media (it can be a great place to crowdsource science questions, but it can also be a cesspool)\n\nTake ownership of your project. I am here to help and to guide you, but this is not my thesis (I have already done one!)\n\nCome to meetings prepared.\nThink independently and critically\nRead broadly\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCaution\n\n\n\nSites like Stack Overflow and Stack Exchange, while extremely useful and valuable for the community, can sometimes contain some robust communication and opinion from strong-minded people.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\n\nAll of the above contributes to your project performance mark\n\n\n\nDon’t be afraid to tell me that you think I’m wrong. I’m a scientist. I’m probably wrong at least half the time.\n\nYour data may contradict my hypotheses or ideas. That’s how science works.\nYou will probably find something in the literature that I wasn’t aware of. I’ll be interested to hear about it.\nYou may well have insights and clever thoughts that I won’t have. You are closer to your project than I am, and that will generate insight.\nDoing science can involve challenges to accepted dogma, and the Scientific Method requires us to prove ideas (usually our own ideas!) wrong. Be bold."

Especially if this is your first time working on a long-form scientific project, or producing a dissertation of this length, please also take time to read our advice on Project and Time Management, and how to go about writing a thesis.\nWe also provide advice on giving scientific presentations - an important component of your project - and Science Communication in general. While tailored towards the BM432 project, the advice is quite general and we hope it will be helpful for some time to come.\n\n\nComputational Biology and Bioinformatics\nIf you are new to computational biology and bioinformatics, projects in this area can be quite challenging. While we design our projects to be as accessible as possible to students with no background in the field, it is unavoidable that you will need to learn new concepts, skills, and tools. We have compiled sets of Learning Resources that can help you with the self-directed learning you may need.\nAs you may be unfamiliar with the wide scope of bioinformatics and computational biology tools and resources available, we have also compiled sets of Online Resources - databases, online services, and other important sites - that may be directly useful for your project. We have also compiled sets of Software Tools that you may be able to download and use on your own computer."
