    "title": "Project Expectations",
    "section": "1 Conducting Your Project",
    "text": "1 Conducting Your Project\n\n1.1 Science:\n\nMaintain a lab notebook, either on paper or electronically. Human memory is fallible! Your notebook should be thorough and legible – if you come back to it in a month’s time, you should be able to reconstruct what you did.\n\nFor each experiment, please write: Objective Background Methods, including deviations from established methods Results Conclusion\n\nFiles should be saved with clear, concise file names and saved where you can find them again. Back up your work frequently and in more than one place – you do not want to lose all of your data!\nAt the end of the project, I expect you to provide me with the raw data files from your work: e.g. for a phylogenetic tree, I expect the .fasta file containing all of the sequences, the multiple sequence alignment of the sequences, and the .newick file for the tree. This is so that projects can be continued/expanded in future years.\n\n\n\n1.2 Teamwork/collegiality:\n\nScience is a team effort and it benefits from people working together in groups – we can accomplish more together than one person working alone can.\nListen respectfully to each other, learn from each other, and contribute as you can.\nBe respectful of others’ different life experiences, learn from them when appropriate, and contribute when appropriate. Do not insult or put down people who share their experiences. Harassment, sexism, racism, or exclusionary comments are not appropriate and prevent people from participating in science.\nRecognize that every person will bring strengths and weaknesses with them. Highlight each others strengths, and help each other overcome our weaknesses.\nIf you find that you have made a mistake: listen, offer a genuine apology, and commit to learning and doing better.\n\n\n\n1.3 Kindness:\n\nBe kind to yourself. Be mindful of your limits, and aware of the fact that you are still in the middle of a global pandemic – give yourself credit for the hard work that you’re doing every day.\nBe kind to others. Give them the benefit of the doubt when needed; remember that online communication often misses nuance or meaning. Remember that everyone is struggling right now and may not be able to be their best selves.\nBe patient. Science can be hard work – things take longer to accomplish, particularly at first; you may need to repeat experiments or start over with a new dataset. This is all part of the process – you are making progress, even though it may not be readily apparent.\n\n\n\n1.4 Communication:\n\nClear, open, honest communication – I cannot help if you don’t let me know that there’s a problem.\nMeetings at least once a week in person or via Zoom (individual and/or group meetings). Zoom etiquette: turning your camera, microphone on/off is completely up to you, no pressure either way.\nBetween meetings, I’m available by e-mail to answer questions or you can schedule a drop-in Zoom (depending on our schedules).\nDon’t be afraid to ask for help:\n\nMe (…this is literally my job!)\nEach other\nThe Microbiology group\nAsk questions in your lectures/open office sessions\nTwitter (a great place to crowdsource science questions)\n\nHow to ask for help: … after Google, reading papers, looking at manuals and FAQs has proven unhelpful!\n\nBe detailed and specific! (“I tried it and it didn’t work” is not a useful question).\nExplain what you were trying to do, exactly how you tried to do it, exactly what happened (e.g. what error message you got) – include screenshots if they help to illustrate the problem. This will save a lot of time and back-and-forth e-mails\n\nTake ownership of your project: I am here to help and to guide you, but this is not my thesis (I have already done one!) Come prepared to meetings Think independently and critically Read broadly All of the above contributes to your project performance mark\nDon’t be afraid to tell me that I’m wrong:\n\nYour data may well contradict my hypotheses or ideas\nYou might find something in the literature that I wasn’t aware of\nYou may well have insights and clever thoughts that I won’t have\nDoing science is about being able to challenge the accepted dogma and prove ideas wrong"

If you can send me your CV and a couple of points you’d like me to highlight, so much the better!\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nA few tips and suggestions for success\n\n\n\n\nTake care of yourself (a healthy mind requires a healthy body)\nStay organized: set yourself deadlines (but be flexible when need be)\nDon’t feel the need to write your draft in one go – it’s much better to work on it a little bit every day (marathon, not a sprint)\nBreak it down into small tasks\nGet into the habit of writing at least a few sentences daily\nTake breaks and let your mind rest/process ideas (take a walk, wash the dishes, drink some tea).\nTake breaks from the screen.\nWhen you read papers, and go to seminars/journal clubs: pay attention to the way that other people explain their science (what works? what doesn’t?)"

    "text": "Getting Started\n\nProject Work\nPlease do read the Project Expectations page, and keep the Key Dates in mind as you carry out your project, as these outline what you should be doing, and when, to keep on track with the project. Especially if this is your first time working on a long-form scientific project, or producing a dissertation of this length, please also take time to read our advice on Project and Time Management, and how to go about writing a thesis.\nWe also provide advice on giving scientific presentations - an important component of your project - and Science Communication in general. While tailored towards the BM432 project, the advice is quite general and we hope it will be helpful for some time to come.\n\n\nComputational Biology and Bioinformatics\nIf you are new to computational biology and bioinformatics, projects in this area can be quite challenging. While we design our projects to be as accessible as possible to students with no background in the field, it is unavoidable that you will need to learn new concepts, skills, and tools. We have compiled sets of Learning Resources that can help you with the self-directed learning you may need.\nAs you may be unfamiliar with the wide scope of bioinformatics and computational biology tools and resources available, we have also compiled sets of Online Resources - databases, online services, and other important sites - that may be directly useful for your project. We have also compiled sets of Software Tools that you may be able to download and use on your own computer."
