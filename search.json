    "text": "1 Conducting Your Project\n\nSome general advice about the group \nHow to avoid cognitive overload \n\n\n1.1 Science:\n\nMaintain a detailed record of your work (i.e. a lab notebook), either on paper or electronically.\n\nAll the projects run by our group are computational. You will probably find it easiest to maintain an electronic record.\nKeeping a lab notebook to document your project \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nImportant\n\n\n\n\nBack up your work frequently and in more than one place - you do not want to lose all of your data!\n\nIt’s a common view in computation biology that, if there are not three copies of your data/work (ideally in two physical locations), it might as well not exist.\n\n\n\n\n\nAt the end of the project, I expect you to provide me with the raw data files from your work. For example:\n\nFor a phylogenetic tree, I expect: the .fasta file containing the unaligned sequences; the multiple sequence alignment used to construct the tree (.fasta, .msa, etc.); and the .newick (or .nex) file for the tree. This is required so that projects can be continued and built upon in future years.\nYou may find it most convenient to manage your project using standard computational biology tools, such as version control (e.g. git and GitHub). I would also find that convenient and strongly recommend it.\n\n\n\n\n1.2 Teamwork and collegiality:\n\nGroup Code of Conduct \nI expect you to help each other. In particular, some of you will have more experience than others in the group, when using computational and bioinformatics tools. You are all doing different projects, but you are using similar tools and techniques. I expect you to share knowledge and understanding kindly with one another.\n\nScience is a team effort and it benefits from people working together in groups. We can accomplish more together than one person working alone can.\nListen respectfully to each other, learn from each other, and contribute as you can.\nBe respectful of others’ different life experiences. Learn from them when appropriate, and contribute when appropriate. Do not insult or put down people who share their experiences.\n\nIf you find that you have made a mistake: listen, offer a genuine apology, and commit to learning and doing better.\n\n\n\n1.3 Kindness:\n\nBe kind to yourself. Be mindful of your limits, and aware of the fact that this is a world in crisis, with a myriad challenges.\n\nGive yourself credit for the hard work that you’re doing every day.\n\nBe kind to others. Give them the benefit of the doubt when needed; remember that online communication often misses nuance or meaning.\n\nRemember that everyone is struggling right now and may not be able to be their best selves.\n\nBe patient. Science can be hard work. Things take longer to accomplish when you are first learning a technique. You may need to repeat experiments or start over with a new dataset. This is all part of the process, and to be expected.\n\nBe assured that you are making progress, even though it may not feel that way at the time.\n\n\n\n\n1.4 Good Communication:\n\nHow to ask for feedback \nHow to ask good questions \nBe clear, open, and honest in your communication\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCaution\n\n\n\nI cannot help if you don’t let me know that there’s a problem.\n\n\n\nWe will meet at least once a week in person or via Zoom (individual and/or group meetings).\n\nZoom etiquette: turning your camera, microphone on/off is completely up to you, no pressure either way.\n\nBetween meetings, I’m available by email to answer questions or you can schedule a drop-in Zoom (depending on our schedules).\nDon’t be afraid to ask for help. You have many resources to call on, including:\n\nMe (…this is literally my job!)\nEach other. Please do talk to and help each other! - we call this “Peer Learning” and it’s deliberately part of the project. It’s not cheating or plagiarism.\nAnyone else in the SIPBS CompBiol Group\nThe Microbiology group\nAsk questions in your lectures/open office sessions\nStack Overflow, Bioinformatics Stack Exchange and other specialist sites\nSocial Media (it can be a great place to crowdsource science questions, but it can also be a cesspool)\n\nTake ownership of your project. I am here to help and to guide you, but this is not my thesis (I have already done one!)\n\nCome to meetings prepared.\nThink independently and critically\nRead broadly\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCaution\n\n\n\nSites like Stack Overflow and Stack Exchange, while extremely useful and valuable for the community, can sometimes contain some robust communication and opinion from strong-minded people.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\n\nAll of the above contributes to your project performance mark\n\n\n\nDon’t be afraid to tell me that you think I’m wrong. I’m a scientist. I’m probably wrong at least half the time.\n\nYour data may contradict my hypotheses or ideas. That’s how science works.\nYou will probably find something in the literature that I wasn’t aware of. I’ll be interested to hear about it.\nYou may well have insights and clever thoughts that I won’t have. You are closer to your project than I am, and that will generate insight.\nDoing science can involve challenges to accepted dogma, and the Scientific Method requires us to prove ideas (usually our own ideas!) wrong. Be bold."

While tailored towards the BM432 project, the advice is quite general and we hope it will be helpful for some time to come.\n\n\nComputational Biology and Bioinformatics\nIf you are new to computational biology and bioinformatics, projects in this area can be quite challenging. While we design our projects to be as accessible as possible to students with no background in the field, it is unavoidable that you will need to learn new concepts, skills, and tools. We have compiled sets of Learning Resources that can help you with the self-directed learning you may need.\nAs you may be unfamiliar with the wide scope of bioinformatics and computational biology tools and resources available, we have also compiled sets of Online Resources - databases, online services, and other important sites - that may be directly useful for your project. We have also compiled sets of Software Tools that you may be able to download and use on your own computer."

    "text": "2 A list of things that can usually be improved\nCommon ways undergraduate theses can be improved: a list\n\nRemember your primary goal: communicating what you did, and what it means, to your reader.\n\nYou are telling the story revealed by your research, not impressing the reader with what you know or a comprehensive account of every experiment you conducted, regardless of whether it contributes to the scientific “story.”\n\nWrite in short, direct, clear sentences.\nUse the active voice whenever possible.\nDefine all abbreviations on first use (unless they’re trivially common, like “DNA”, but - even then - put them in a glossary/abbreviations section).\nDon’t overstretch your conclusions. This is a 6-8 week undergraduate project, not a £2m multi-team research project.\n\nYou don’t need results to be significant, groundbreaking, or even decisive. You need to show the reader you are a scientist and understand the context and realistic contribution of your work.\nBe cautious about implications when appropriate, e.g. “may enable,” “suggests,” “is consistent with,” etc.\n\nYou can use “I” instead of “we” in your thesis.\nThe lay abstract needs to be written in everyday language, and should express similar information to the technical abstract.\nThe abstract should not contain citations/references.\nThe introduction should give the reader enough information to understand the work you will be describing.\nEvery result in Results should have the methodology by which it was obtained clearly described in the Methods section.\nFor bioinformatics methods, every software tool should have its version number indicated, and a citation. Also state the parameters used.\n\nIt is acceptable to state “default parameters were used unless otherwise indicated,” but remember to indicate changes from the default settings.\nThe best way to preent your bioinformatics methods is to, where space permits, reproduce the command-lines you used (but redact long paths to files). Alternatively, provide the script as a downloadable file or appendix. If using a Galaxy workflow, provide the link to a shared version of this.\n\nFor bioinformatics methods, state the version number of each database you used, or the date on which you accessed it.\nThe Methods section should include enough information to enable a competent scientist to reproduce the work.\nIf your study focuses on one specific result, or a small number of results, have a separate Discussion section.\nIf your study generates multiple results, and especially if the results inform each other or tell a sequential story where later results are dependent on earlier results, consider combining Results and Discussions into a single section: “Results and Discussion.”\nEvery statement of fact should be supported either by a citation, or the work that you are reporting.\nAll taxonomic names should be appropriately italicised.\n“Thus” means “as a consequence of what was just explained” - inappropriate use gives the impression of poor logic and understanding.\nFigure legends should explain the meaning and importance of the figure without the reader needing to make reference to the text.\nReferences should be cited in the text, and presented in the bibliography, in a standard manner.\n\nUse reference management software."

Spend time thinking about what you want to say before you write anything.\n\n\n\n\n3.2 How to improve as a writer\n\n\n\n\n\n\nYou can only improve as a writer by writing\n\n\n\nWe do not improve at things only by thinking about them. I cannot make a cup of tea by thinking about a kettle. If I want a better cup of tea I need to put the kettle on. If I want to improve my writing, I first have to write something.\nIt may not be very good, especially as a first draft. But if I do not write I cannot get better at writing.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nYou can only improve as a writer if the writing is read\n\n\n\nIt is not enough only to write. I do not know if my cup of tea is better than the last one unless it is tasted. I will not know if my writing is improving unless it is read.\nJust as I can taste my own cup of tea, I can read my own writing and form a judgement. Before sharing my writing with others, I should read it myself.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nYou can better judge your own writing if you have read other writing\n\n\n\nIf I want to know that my writing is improving, I need to know what “improvement” means. If I want to know whether my cup of tea is good or bad, I can taste it and decide whether I like it. But if I have not tasted other good and bad cups of tea, I will not know how to eliminate the bad, or exaggerate the good. I need to have read good and bad writing to have a sense of direction for my own writing.\nI can always compare my tea to other cups I have made before, but I may never find a new flavour that way. If I only compare this writing to my previous efforts, I may never find a new way to express myself. It is good to try other people’s tea, and to read other people’s writing.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nYour writing will get better if you receive constructive feedback\n\n\n\nMy perspective is limited by my experiences. My imagination of what a cup of tea could be is determined by which teas I have drunk before. If a friend who has drunk many more different teas tastes my tea and suggests a way to make it better, maybe they have a new perspective on what makes tea good that I could use. If a friend reads my writing and suggests a way to make it clearer and better, maybe they have a perspective on communication that I could benefit from.\nYou need someone who is not you to give an honest perspective on your writing through constructive feedback."

    "text": "4 Three Common Scientific Writing Mistakes and How to Avoid Them\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\n\nProblem: Lack of attention to sentence structure\nExample: “Some students have really excellent ideas and are putting those ideas in their theses and making sure that they reference other people’s ideas from the literature correctly and using reference management software in appropriate ways and including a list of references at the end of their thesis. So great.”\nSolution: Be ruthless about editing your sentences until each sentence contains just one idea (the example above contained at least 4 separate ideas). It may help to read your writing aloud, as in the above example: take note of where you would naturally pause to take a breath.\nAt one end of the extreme, you have long, convoluted sentences that try to do too much (the first sentence in the example). At the other end, you have another type of grammatical disaster - beware sentence fragments.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\n\nProblem: Excessive use of scientific jargon, colloquialisms, and/or acronyms\nExample: “We spun down the cells and washed them with PBS.”\nSolution: “spun down the cells” is something you might say colloquially (and that’s fine), However, in formal scientific language, you would say that the cells were centrifuged. Avoid colloquialisms and make sure you always define abbreviations (like PBS) at the first use.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\n\nProblem: Lack of precision and/or attention to detail\nExample: “The genes in E. coli were translated and cheY was well conserved.”\nSolution: Pay careful attention to conventions in your field and precise usage of terms. Ask a friend or colleague to look over your writing and make sure that it conveys your intended meaning.\nHere, gene and species names should be italicized by convention (N.B. cheY refers to the gene, CheY refers to the protein). “Translated” is mis-used (remember that genes are transcribed). Finally, the sentence is, overall, frustratingly vague (which genes? what does “well conserved” mean?).\nA better and more meaningful version: “The genes involved in chemotaxis in E. coli were expressed under these experimental conditions (mid-logarithmic phase in MOPS minimal medium at 37° C). cheY was well-conserved, with homologs found in 99.4% of all analysed E. coli genomes.)"

    "text": "1 What’s my protein?\nI was assigned PHI:3077 - Lsr2 from Mycobacterium tuberculosis\n\n1.1 Checking PHI-Base\nThe reference describing this protein in PHI-Base is Bartek et al. (2014): “Mycobacterium tuberculosis Lsr2 Is a Global Transcriptional Regulator Required for Adaptation to Changing Oxygen Levels and Virulence.” The essential findings in an Lsr2 knockout are:\n\nLsr2 is not required for DNA protection (this strain was equally susceptible as the wild type to DNA-damaging agents)\nThe lsr2 mutant displayed severe growth defects under normoxic and hyperoxic conditions, but it was not required for growth under low-oxygen conditions.\nLsr2 was required for adaptation to anaerobiosis. The defect in anaerobic adaptation led to a marked decrease in viability during anaerobiosis, as well as a lag in recovery from it.\nGene expression profiling of the Δlsr2 mutant under aerobic and anaerobic conditions in conjunction with published DNA binding-site data indicates that Lsr2 is a global transcriptional regulator controlling adaptation to changing oxygen levels.\nThe Δlsr2 strain was capable of establishing an early infection in the BALB/c mouse model; however, it was severely defective in persisting in the lungs and caused no discernible lung pathology.\n\nThis suggests that Lsr2 binds to DNA and acts within the pathogen to control its response to encountering the host as an environment (i.e. what we describe as pathogenicity). I would be on the lookout for suggestions in the literature, and from what I discover from databases and annotations, for elements of the sequence and structure associated with DNA-binding.\n\n\n1.2 Checking UniProt\nThe PHI-Base entry links to this UniProt record: P9WIP7\n\n1.2.1 Functional information\nThe UniProt record leads to further references supporting protein function (six publications under “Function”)\n\nDNA-bridging protein that has both architectural and regulatory roles (PubMed:18187505).\nInfluences the organization of chromatin and gene expression by binding non-specifically to DNA, with a preference for AT-rich sequences, and bridging distant DNA segments (PubMed:20133735).\nBinds in the minor groove of AT-rich DNA (PubMed:21673140).\nRepresses expression of multiple genes involved in a broad range of cellular processes, including major virulence factors or antibiotic-induced genes, such as iniBAC or efpA (PubMed:17590082), and genes important for adaptation of changing O2 levels (PubMed:24895305).\nMay also activate expression of some gene (PubMed:24895305).\nMay coordinate global gene regulation and virulence (PubMed:20133735).\nAlso protects mycobacteria against reactive oxygen intermediates during macrophage infection by acting as a physical barrier to DNA degradation (PubMed:19237572); the physical protection has been questioned (PubMed:24895305).\nA strain overexpressing this protein consumes O2 more slowly than wild-type (PubMed:24895305).\n\nThe feature viewer gives me information about regions of the protein:\n\n\n\nUniProt Feature viewer\n\n\nThis indicates that there is mutagenesis evidence supporting structure-function interpretation:\n\nresidues 97-99: Description Loss of DNA-binding, in fragment 66-112. Alternative sequence AGA Evidence Publication: 21673140 (PubMed EuropePMC) Cross-references UniProtKB P9WIP7\nresidue 84: Description Loss of activity. Can form dimers but does not bind DNA. Alternative sequence A Evidence Publication: 18187505\nresidue 45 Description Loss of activity. Alternative sequence A Evidence Publication: 18187505\nresidue 28 Description Loss of activity. Alternative sequence A Evidence Publication: 18187505\n\nThere are ten papers linked from UniProt to follow up about function, and Uniprot also provides GO terms for functional annotation.\nUniProt has so far provided leads about sequence-structure-function relationships, the key role of this protein in pathogenicity, and even highlighted individual residues with a potential functional role.\n\n\n1.2.2 Structural information\nThere is an AlphaFold structure, indicated in the feature viewer, that includes a low-confidence region.\nThere are PDB records of solved structures: 2KNG, 4E1P, 41R, 6QKP, 6QKQ; 4E1P appears to be highest quality. Solved structures are generally more reliable than AlphaFold.\nEvolutionary Trace analysis exists at http://mammoth.bcm.tmc.edu/cgi-bin/report_maker_ls/uniprotTraceServerResults.pl?identifier=P9WIP7 - this maps sequence variation onto structure.\nIt looks like there will be ample structural information for me to begin inferring structure-function relationships.\n\n\n1.2.3 Sequence information\nUniProt gives the protein sequence as:\n&gt;sp|P9WIP7|LSR2_MYCTU Nucleoid-associated protein Lsr2 OS=Mycobacterium tuberculosis (strain ATCC 25618 / H37Rv) OX=83332 GN=lsr2 PE=1 SV=1\nMAKKVTVTLVDDFDGSGAADETVEFGLDGVTYEIDLSTKNATKLRGDLKQWVAAGRRVGG\nRRRGRSGSGRGRGAIDREQSAAIREWARRNGHNVSTRGRIPADVIDAYHAAT\n\n\n1.2.4 Homologues\nUniProt provides multiple links to external resources listing homologues; these have varying numbers of homologues, because the tools work in different ways.\n\nInParanoid\nOrthoDB\nPhylomeDB\nEggNOG\n\nUniProt also lists the sequences it knows about that share a minimum level of similarity, at 100%, 90% and 50%, in the Similar Proteins section of the page (Figure 1). At time of writing, there are 269 sequences sharing at least 50% identity at protein level.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 1: The Similar Proteins section of the P9WIP7 record\n\n\n\nBy clicking on the View All button, or on the View all 269 entries link, we can obtain a more detailed view of the data (Figure 2). This page also presents a Download link that lets us download all 270 sequences (the 269 homologues and P9WIP7 itself).\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 2: A more detailed view of the 269 homologues of P9WIP7\n\n\n\nClicking on the Download link presents options. We want to download the FASTA (Canonical) records - these contain the protein sequence information and relevant headers - and we do not want a compressed file (Figure 3).\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 3: UniProt sequence download options: choose FASTA (Canonical) and do not request compressed format\n\n\n\nClicking the Download button returns the 269 homologous sequences, and our original P9WIP7 sequence, in the file below.\n\n269 homologues of Lsr2 (FASTA)"

    "text": "2 Aligning homologues\nTaking the 50% identity sequences as our starting point, we could usually align them using tools in UniProt, but with ≈270 sequences there are too many. So we’ll have to use another approach.\n\n2.1 Align using MAFFT on Galaxy\nWe could download a standalone tool, but we’re going to use Galaxy instead (don’t forget to register and log in) We’ll use MAFFT to align sequences.\n\nLoad the 270 sequence dataset\nFind the MAFFT tool (you might as well use the FFT-NS-2 default method)\nClick on Run Tool\n\nThis will generate the sequence alignment for you in FASTA format. Download the alignment to your own machine (click on the floppy disk icon).\n\n\n2.2 Visualise alignment with JalView\nTo visualise the alignment, we will use a standalone software tool: JalView. Download and install this on your own machine.\n\nJalView home page\n\nTo visualise the alignment:\n\nStart JalView\nClick on File -&gt; Input Alignment -&gt; From File, then select your downloaded alignment\nClick on the maximise button to see the larger alignment\n\nWe can see the full length of the sequence and that similar residues are aligned vertically, in Figure 4. We can see any insertions/deletions for specific sequences visually. The extent of conservation, and a consensus sequence, can be seen below the alignment. We can colour the alignment to highlight aspects of the biology/biochemistry:\n\nClick on the Colour menu item\nChoose a colour scheme (e.g. Clustal to recreate Figure 4)\n\nScrolling up and down the alignment shows where some sequences are quite different, or may be incomplete. We might want to delete some sequences from the collection.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nImportant\n\n\n\nWhenever we modify our dataset, we need to record which sequences are removed or otherwise altered, and our grounds for removing them (and this should be described in the Methods section of the thesis).\n\n\n\n2.2.1 Arranging sequences by similarity\nInitially the alignment puts quite different sequences next to each other. We can sort the sequences by similarity.\n\nSelect all the sequences (Select -&gt; Select All, or Ctrl/Cmd-A)\nCalculate -&gt; Calculate Tree, PCA, or PaSiMap\nSelect Neighbour Joining Tree and BLOSUM 62\nClick Calculate\n\nWhen the tree is created, sort the alignment\n\nView -&gt; Sort Alignment By Tree\n\nNow, when you click within the tree, sequences will be coloured by where they are found on the tree\nYou can save the tree as a Newick file, to visualise in other software (like Dendroscope or FigTree):\n\nFile -&gt; Save As -&gt; Newick format\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 4: JalView alignment\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 5: JalView Neighbour-Joining Tree\n\n\n\n\nJalView Neighbour-Joining Tree file (NEWICK)\n\nThe combination of alignment and tree tells me several things immediately:\n\nThat there are several distinct clusters of similar Lsr2 sequences (clades/groups in the tree, visible differences between sequences in the alignment)\nThat there are two regions of high sequence conservation, with a region of low sequence conservation separating them (from the alignment - the gaps that run down the middle of the proteins)\nThat I need to remove some sequences because they’re relatively low quality (e.g. the sequences with half the protein missing, in the alignment)"

    "section": "3 Generating a phylogenetic tree",
    "text": "3 Generating a phylogenetic tree\nUsing a sequence alignment to produce a phylogenetic tree can be a complex and detailed topic. There is an entire research field dedicated to the problem of generating an accurate representation of evolutionary history from protein and/or nucleotide sequences. Here we have space to quickly go through basic approaches to producing an initial tree and, if you would like to know more, please check out the links below.\n\nBM329 Workshop B – UPGMA: https://sipbs-compbiol.github.io/BM329_Block_B_Workshop/upgma.html\nEMBL’s Introduction to Phylogenetics: https://www.ebi.ac.uk/training/online/courses/introduction-to-phylogenetics/what-is-phylogenetics/\nConor Meehan’s online course: https://conmeehan.github.io/PathogenDataCourse/IntroToPhylogenetics.html\n\n\n3.1 Generating a basic phylogenetic tree\nWe have already produced a basic phylogenetic tree using JalView (Section 2.2.1), as shown in Figure 5. To make this tree, Jalview used the Neighbor-Joining algorithm and the BLOSUM62 amino acid substitution matrix - some advantages and disadvantages of the method are noted in this paper.\nIn general, we would prefer to use a more sophisticated method such as Maximum Likelihood or Bayesian phylogenetic reconstruction, using the underlying nucleotide sequences rather than the protein sequences. We would want to use the nucleotide sequences because they carry more evolutionary information (the same amino acid may be encoded by different codons in two sequences, and the differences between those codons is evolutionary information). We’d use Maximum Likelihood/Bayesian approaches because they give better estimates of the evolutionary history leading to the sequences in the alignment than Neighbour-Joining (which has systematic biases in its approach).\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTip\n\n\n\nYou can use some of these more advanced phylogenetic tools at Galaxy\n\n\n\n\n3.2 Generating a more sophisticated phylogenetic tree\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\n\nFor the example below I have removed some distant/incomplete sequences, and a short leader sequence that isn’t present in most proteins, to make the alignment truncated_sequences.fa.\n\n\nTo generate a Maximum Likelihood phylogenetic tree from the truncated_sequences.fa file, we can use the RAxML tool in Galaxy (Figure 6).\n\nSelect the RAxML tool in the tools sidebar\nChoose the Amino Acid model type\nChoose the PROTCAT substitution model and the BLOSUM62 matrix\nClick on Run Tool\n\nThe tree will take a short while to be generated, and will produce five output files (Figure 7). The tree information can be found in the Best-scoring ML tree output.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 6: Settings for generating a protein phylogenetic tree with RAxML in Galaxy`\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 7: RAxML output on Galaxy"

It is a quick way to see the overall tree structure, but is very limited in terms of customisability and interaction. The image is usually too large to view all at once, and needs to be downloaded.

http://tree.bio.ed.ac.uk/software/Figtree/\n\n\n4.1 Visualising a tree with FigTree\nThe FigTree tool is a useful, cross-platform phylogenetic tree visualisation package that can generate very useful figures at publication quality. It is fairly straightforward to use, and good for experimenting with tree layouts and options.\n\nDownload FigTree from http://tree.bio.ed.ac.uk/software/Figtree/ and install it on your machine\nStart FigTree and open the RAxML best-scoring tree, downloaded from Galaxy (the file extension will be .nhx)\n\nYou should be presented with a screen that resembles Figure 10, showing a similar, but reshaped, view to that in Figure 9. A quick visual comparison should be enough to convince you that, as a scientist, you can make many choices about visualisation that can help the reader understnd your tree, and that can help you make your point better, in your manuscript.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 10: Initial FigTree view of the RAxML tree\n\n\n\n\n4.1.1 Rooted or unrooted?\nReal trees have roots, but phylogenetic trees may or may not have roots - it depends on the method used to construct them.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTip\n\n\n\nIn a phylogenetic tree, the root is the most ancient common ancestor of all sequences/species/taxa in the tree.\n\n\nUPGMA and Neighbour-Joining trees have roots because of the way the tree construction algorithm works. This may or may not be a “true” root, in the sense that it represents the true last common ancestor of all sequences in the tree.\nMaximum Likelihood and Bayesian trees do not have roots enforced on them by their algorithms, but if you choose sequences so that you know something about the evolutionary history of your organisms, you can accurately identify the true root of a tree.\nThe tree I generated with RAxML is a Maximum Likelihood tree, so I’m going to visualise it as an unrooted tree, first, in Figure 11.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 11: Unrooted maximum likelihood tree. Note that the FigTree Tip Labels setting is unchecked so that the tree is prominent.\n\n\n\nLooking at Figure 11, I can see that the top left pert of the tree has very long branches (the lines between nodes of the tree that either represent divergence events or the sequences themselves). This implies that the sequences at the ends of these branches have undergone much more evolutionary change (i.e. underwent more substitutions) than the other sequences. This has two broad explanations:\n\nThis reflects the true evolutionary history of these sequences. They may have retained more substitutions because they were under extreme selection pressure (not unusual for pathogen effectors).\nThis is an artefact (i.e. not a real biological result). We may have included sequences in our analysis that do not belong - they appear to have accepted many substitutions because they are too different to the rest of the sequences to really belong in the same category.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWarning\n\n\n\nWe cannot decide between these two options by looking at the tree alone. We need to do more work analysing the sequences and the tree.\n\n\n\n\n4.1.2 Midpoint Rooting\nMidpoint rooting is a way of deciding upon a root point for an unrooted tree, without any reference to the true biology. It works by finding the longest path between any two taxa (i.e. end points on the tree) and setting the root at that position. Using the Midpoint Root option on visually unrooted tree doesn’t change it’s appearance drastically, as you can see from Figure 12.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTip\n\n\n\nIn FigTree the Midpoint Root option is in the Tree menu.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 12: Unrooted maximum likelihood tree, with midpoint rooting. Due to the visual presentation of this tree, the midpoint rooting appears to have no effect.\n\n\n\nBut, if we switch the display style to a phylogram as in Figure 13, we can see that the tree appears “balanced”, with a clear outgroup at the bottom end of the tree. We can see three clear sets of sequences that apper to be distanced from each other in the tree.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 13: Unrooted maximum likelihood tree, with midpoint rooting. Due to the visual presentation of this tree as a phylogram, the midpoint rooting “balances” the tree, and we can see three groups of sequences that are relatively dissimilar from each other: the small group at the top of the tree, the large group in the centre, and the sequences at the very bottom of the tree.\n\n\n\n\n4.1.3 Interpreting the tree\nAs noted above, the very long branches separating our sequences into three groups could represent true evolutionary history, or be an artefact from analysing sequences that don’t really belong together.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTip\n\n\n\nGenerally, I would expect a set of related sequences in a phylogenetic tree to have about the same “distance” from the root to each tip. The presence of these three distinct groups could be a red flag that I’ve done something wrong - or it could be very interesting!\n\n\nThe first thing I want to know is what sequences are in each of these three groups. I first ladderise (Tree -&gt; I ncreasing node order) the tree, and turn Tip Labels back on. Then I use the Expansion slider to stretch the tree vertically and make space between the tip labels, as in Figure 14.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 14: Ladderised maximum likelihood tree with tip labels (some of the tree disappears out of the top of the FigTree window.\n\n\n\nBy using the Zoom slider and increasing the font size of the Tip Labels menu I can see the sequence names more clearly in Figure 15.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 15: Ladderised maximum likelihood tree with tip labels, zoomed to see the two most distantly-related sequence sets.\n\n\n\nBy inspecting this zoomed-in view, I can see that the main group of sequences is annotated with codes that end in the letters NOCA, NOCBR or similar; most of the sequences in the dataset have codes like MYCO, MYCRU and so on. This tells me that:\n\nall of the main set of sequences derive from Mycobacterium\nthe larger group of outlying sequences derive from Nocardia\n\nThe single other outlying sequence appears to come from Mycobacterium, so we should look at the sequence alignment to see whether there is an issue with the alignment (Figure 16).\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 16: Jalview visualisation of the sequence alignment, centring on the Nocardia sequences, and the singleoutlying Mycobacterium sequence.\n\n\n\nFrom this alignment, we can see that the Nocardia sequences are broadly similar to each other, and do align with the Mycobacterium sequences, even though there appears to be an inserted region (we can look at the location of this on the structure, later), and quite a bit of sequence difference. This kind of pattern is consistent with there being a common ancestor of this sequence in Nocardia and Mycobacterium, and them being separated by speciation, then evolving separately for a long period.\nThe Mycobacterium sequence that looks out of place is tr|A0A1Z4F4V8|A0A1Z4F4V8_9MYCO/27-140 - the sequence looks similar enough to the others to appear to be validly aligned, but it is quite different to the other Mycobacterium proteins. It it not clear at this point why these differences should be present, so we continue our analysis keeping this sequence in the dataset.\n\n\n4.2 General conclusions from the tree\nAt this point we can draw some tentative conclusions from the tree.\n\nThere was probably a related sequence present in an ancestor of Mycobacterium and Nocardia, and the homologues we find in the database have diverged after speciation.\n\nIt is not clear whether these proteins have the same function(s) in these two genera.\n\nThere is a questionable Mycobacterium homologue, but we don’t have sufficient evidence to exclude it from the analysis as an artefact and can proceed assuming there is a biological relationship.\nThere are, within the Mycobacteria, several groups of related sequences (we call these clades) which might represent any or all of:\n\nspeciation (i.e. the tree reflects organism history and evolution)\nfunctional divergence (i.e. each clade represents a different biological interaction, activity, or function)\nbut we can’t tell from the tree alone what the (most) likely explanations are - we need to do more work\n\nThe MYCO coding does not give us species information and it’s not possible to see whether the groupings of sequences correspond to speciation, or paralogy within species. We would need to do some bioinformatics work to label these sequences with their corresponding taxa."
