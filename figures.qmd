## Figure Preparation checklist

1. Determine what message you want the reader to take from your figure, and the most effective way of conveying that point
2. Remove any extraneous or distracting data that distracts from the main message of your figure (taking care not to make the figure misleading by doing so)
3. Determine how large the figure needs to be: how much space will it take up on a page?
4. Will it be easy for your reader to see key details if the figure is this size?
5. Check that the figure is clear and not pixellated: will your reader be able to see all the important details? Is the resolution good enough?
  - You should always prepare figures in _vector format_ (i.e. PDF, PS, or SVG) where possible to avoid pixellation issues.
6. Check that the colour scheme you have chosen is colour-blind friendly and not visually jarring
7. Check that any fonts used are legible at the size printed
8. Figure titles should give a concise "take-home message" conveying the result(s) shown in the figure
9. Figure legends should give enough detail about the experiment for the reader to understand what was done (the figure should be able to stand on its own)

## Dr Feeney's pet peeves for figures

- [Why You *Must* Plot Your Growth Data On a Semi-log Graph](https://schaechter.asmblog.org/schaechter/2018/07/why-you-must-plot-your-growth-data-on-semi-log-graph-paper.html) - _TBH, this is trivial to do now in most graphic packages, so there's no excuse - LP_
- Make sure you include a scale on any images that need them (e.g., micrographs, phylogenetic trees)
- By convention, figure titles and legends are presented **below** the corresponding figure, while table titles are presented **above** the corresponding table.
- Make sure your text is formatted correctly within your figure (e.g., species names should be italicized, gene and protein names should be formatted correctly)
